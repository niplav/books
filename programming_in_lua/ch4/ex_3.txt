repeat-until is a construct similar to
do-while in C, a construct which is also
used rarely there. Apparently, in C only
5% of loops in C code are do-while loops.
However, repeat-until can be useful to avoid
initializing a variable the same way it is
incremented in the loop, saving one line.
It makes elegant solutions easier, but not
much beyond that, so it could be left out
easily.

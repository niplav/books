Jumping out of a function would jump into the scope of a local variable,
which is not possible (per definition) in lua.
This would also cause problems in a function calling itself and
jumping back into itself (or two different functions calling each other
recursively), since there would be no good way to determine whether the
goto would simply jump inside the function or outside into a previous
call of itself.

One good way to format the sequence of bytes
would be to display it in a string with escaped
bytes in hexadecimal format, split into several
lines with `"\z"`. By doing this problems with
line length can be avoided and performance is
probably not very bad, considering that computers
handle byte sequences considerably well.
Readability can, but should not be a problem,
since when dealing with arbitrary byte sequences
the value in hexadecimal is used more frequently
than the ASCII value.

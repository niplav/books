Disadvantage: A programming language is much more low-level than a
modeling language made exactly for that purpose. Also, a modeling
language is much easier to intuitively understand and learn than a
programming language.
Advantage: There is no separate step from translating the model to
the implementation. There is no need to learn a new language for the
developers.

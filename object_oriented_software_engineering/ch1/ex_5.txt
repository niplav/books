"The TicketDistributor will be at most one and a half meters tall.":
A higher TicketDistributor would be too fragile and unstable to be
operational. Furthermore, a taller TicketDistributor would be harder
to maintain, since some parts could be out of reach.
"The TicketDistributor will include two redundant computer systems."
This is necessary because if one computer fails, the other one can
take over. Redundancy is pretty important in fault tolerant computer
systems that are not regularly maintained.
"The TicketDistributor interface will consist of a touch screen for
displaying instructions and accessing commands and a single button for
aborting transactions.":
A separate button to abort all transactions makes it clearer and prevents
unwanted ticked purchases. The touch screen will make the interface more
flexible and modifiable.

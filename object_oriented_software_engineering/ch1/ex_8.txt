The first usage of "account" is clearly an application domain concept,
since it is talked about independently from the system.
The second usage of "account" is tied to the solution domain, since it
is dependent on the application (and an online connection).
The third and fourth usage are also in the solution domain, since they
now clearly represent data structures that are tied to the implementation
of the system.

"A use case is an abstraction that describes all possible scenarios
involving the described functionality. A scenario is an instance of a
use case describing a concrete set of actions."
A scenario is good for brainstorming and figuring out concrete usages of
the system in a very early stage, use cases are developed from structures
in scenarios that can be abstracted.

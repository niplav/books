4-4: SetArm, WatchUser
The WatchUser turns the Button to move the Arm to the desired Location
on the WatchFace. There is a specific part of the two use cases that is
common to both use cases, so an «include» relationship is preferable
to the «extend» relationship, which would only make sense if a use
case were part of another, bigger use case.

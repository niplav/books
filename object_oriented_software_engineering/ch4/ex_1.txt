SetWatch, WatchUser Sandra
Sandra takes off his watch and realizes that it is two minutes late. She
pulls the AufziehButton and starts moving the arm of the watch that
signifies the minute by turning the button. After moving the arm around a
little bit, she settles on being half a minute ahead of the real time,
since higher accuracy is difficult to attain. Then she pushes the
AufzieButton in, thus resuming the measuring of time by the watch.
